We're one step closer to add our form. Please go to setup page, and paste that code into your site. But, if you have read the comment in the code, you might want to remove the reCAPTCHA code block in order to make things work. Otherwise it's not gonna work, and to make it work, you'll need to configure reCAPTCHA and add it's secret key to the form settings.

If everything went right, you should be able to see a form on the page you placed the code. It's not gonna look beautiful, but submittable. Go ahead and try to submit it, try what is promised to you.
